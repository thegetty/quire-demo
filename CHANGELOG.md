### Added
- `accordion` and `accordionGlobalControls` shortcodes
- Adds `addPairedShortcode` to shortcode factory to provide page to paired shortcodes

- Overwrite `markdown-it-footnote` footnote_ref and footnote_tail rules to not rely on `state.env` but to render footnotes and footnote reference in place, which allows footnotes to be created within shortcodes that render markdown using the markdownify filter
